Though a detailed API and some brief official guides are delivered with Spark, I still miss the easy-to-use, consistency, and completeness of [Pandas's document](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/). Hence the post is created to collect and share the study material about Spark. Please feel free to contact me if you have any recommendation.
